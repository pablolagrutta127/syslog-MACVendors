# syslog-MACVendors
Retrieve vendor for each MAC address included in a text file

1) Create an account on https://macvendors.com/register
2) Replace the api_token with your own API Token delivered by the mac vendors API in the first step
3) Replace the imported_file with the path to the text file you want to get all MAC addresses information
4) After running, the results will be shown in df_data_std DataFrame


API Limitation: tester account has limited number of requests.Because of that, I change to the new API_MacVendor.py
